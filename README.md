Implementation of a Dashboard for Health Data Visualization

The functionality of the dashboard is enriched with a wide range of visualizations such as
boxplots, heatmaps, barcharts, piecharts, linecharts, histograms, Gantt Plots, offering
various perspectives in data analysis.

Particular emphasis has been placed on the interactivity of the dashboard, specifically on
the ability to filter the data, sort it according to specific criteria (ascending order per
column), drill-down for detailed viewing, navigate between different tabs/pages, select
specific data segments for further analysis/comparison, customize the appearance of the
dashboard by hiding or showing parts of it, dynamic updates and data export in csv file
format.
